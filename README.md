# Mini Project: Dynamic Programming

In this project, I wrote implementations of many classical dynamic programming algorithms.

### Part 0: Explore FrozenLakeEnv
In this section, I create an instance of the FrozenLake environment.

### Part 1: Iterative Policy Evaluation

In this section, I wrote my own implementation of iterative policy evaluation.

### Part 2: Obtain q_\pi from v_\pi

In this section, I worte a function that takes the state-value function estimate as input, along with some state s\in\mathcal{S}.  It returns the **row in the action-value function** corresponding to the input state s\in\mathcal{S}.  That is, my function accepts as input both v_\pi and s, and return q_\pi(s,a) for all a\in\mathcal{A}(s).

### Part 3: Policy Improvement

In this section, I wrote my own implementation of policy improvement. 

### Part 4: Policy Iteration

In this section, I wrote my own implementation of policy iteration.  The algorithm returns the optimal policy, along with its corresponding state-value function.

### Part 5: Truncated Policy Iteration

In this section, I wrote my own implementation of truncated policy iteration.

### Part 6: Value Iteration

In this section, I wrote my own implementation of value iteration.
